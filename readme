### 🚑 The Problem
In an emergency, doctors have zero information about an unconscious patient. Existing hospital systems (Private vs Government) are siloed and do not talk to each other.

### 💡 The Solution
MyHealthID leverages the **National Digital ID** framework to allow authorized medical personnel to instantly retrieve critical data (Blood Type, Severe Allergies, Emergency Contacts) by scanning a patient's ID/QR.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   **Backend:** PHP (Native), MySQL
*   **Frontend:** Bootstrap 5, HTML5
*   **Hardware:** Works on any smartphone with a camera (No specialized scanners needed).

### 🚀 Key Features
1.  **Instant Retrieval:** < 3 seconds to get critical allergy info.
2.  **Privacy Audit:** Every scan is logged in a centralized "Access Log" (Anti-Stalking/Privacy protection).
3.  **Cross-Platform:** Bridges the gap between Private & Public healthcare data.

### 📸 How to Demo
1.  Open `admin.php` on a Laptop (Acts as Hospital Database).
2.  Open `scan.php?id=900101-14-1234` on a Mobile Phone (Acts as Doctor).
3.  Update an allergy in Admin -> Watch it update instantly on the Phone.
